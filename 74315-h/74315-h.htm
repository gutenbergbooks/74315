<small><span class="smcap">Morality as the Interest
of the Stronger</span></small></h2>
</div>


<p>Thrasymachus appears in the first
book of Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite>, in which the
speakers discuss the nature of Justice.
Several tentative definitions of Justice
are given, which Socrates has no difficulty
in showing to be inadequate by the
peculiarly irritating methods of dialectic
for which the Athenians so excusably
poisoned him. Thrasymachus then breaks
in. He is a blustering, overbearing
personage, who makes long speeches
instead of answering Socrates’ questions,
and, when driven into a corner, charges
the latter rather irrelevantly with having
a bad cold and omitting to use his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Required to sustain an unpopular
thesis, he is not unnaturally represented
as an offensive person. The trick is an
old one and argues well for Plato’s sense
of dramatic fitness. It should not,
however, blind us to the plausibility of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Thrasymachus’ position. Justice, he says,
is the interest of the stronger. Asked
how he maintains this view, he points out
that the stronger control the government
and make the laws. These laws are not
unnaturally made in their own interest;
in other words, matters are so contrived
that, by the mere process of obeying the
laws, citizens are led to further the interests
of those who govern them. Morality,
which is the name we give to law-abiding
conduct, is, therefore, a device on the
part of the rulers to ensure subservience
and contentment on the part of their
subjects. Since subservient subjects are
a joy and a credit to intelligent rulers,
we may say that justice, and indeed
morality in general, is the interest of the
stronger.</p>

<p>The view that morality is unnatural
to human beings and is imposed by law
in the teeth of primitive instincts which
are fundamentally non-moral, recurs at
pretty regular intervals throughout the
recorded history of what passes for human
thought. It rests upon what is called the
social contract theory of society, and leads
to the conclusion that human nature is
fundamentally wicked.</p>

<p>The life of man in a state of nature was,
as the philosopher Hobbes tells us, “solitary,
poor, nasty, brutish and short.” His
hand was against his fellows and every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
man’s hand was against him. Men acted
offensively<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> towards each other as and
when they pleased, and were restrained by
nothing but fear for their own safety.
Finding this state of affairs intolerable,
men agreed to renounce their natural
right to act offensively towards their
fellows on condition that their fellows
made a similar concession as regards
themselves. The best thing of all, of
course, was to do what you liked to others
without their having the right to retaliate.
Since this seemed impracticable, the next
best thing was to renounce the full
liberty to do what one liked, seeing that
it was attended by the obviously
unpleasant consequence to oneself of
a similar liberty in others, and to venture
only upon those actions that the law
allowed. Society then was a <i lang="la">pis aller</i>.
Your neighbour, it was true, could not
harm you, but then no longer could you
work your own sweet will upon your
neighbour. Men lived at peace with one
another, not because they were naturally
peaceable and law abiding, but because
they feared the consequences of being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
found out if they were not. Once that
fear of consequences was removed, they
would revert to their primitive, natural
wickedness. Let a man, for example,
learn how to become invisible at will and,
as Plato points out, no virgin would be
safe, no strong box unrifled. Man, then,
is made moral by law; he is not moral by
nature.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The term ‘acting offensively’ in this connection
is used to cover primitive conduct of the kind
which is supposed to attract wicked and violent
men, as, for example, carrying off your neighbour’s
wife, raping his daughter, stealing his spoons,
bashing in or otherwise mutilating his face, and
so forth.</p>

</div>

<p>Now the man who makes the laws is
in one sense like the man who has learnt
how to become invisible. I do not mean
that he can break the laws with impunity,
but he can see to it that he has no incentive
to break them. Thus we have the majestic
impartiality of the modern law which forbids
rich and poor alike to sleep in doorways.
He can also, as Thrasymachus
points out, ensure that, so long as others
keep them, his own power will be automatically
safeguarded. And, since the
law is at once the prop and the mirror
of the public opinion of the community,
and, since the public opinion of the community
is in matters of conduct at once
the guardian and the arbiter of conventional
morality, we may further say
that the habit of acting in a way of which
the public opinion of the community
approves will be found to conduce to
the maintenance of the <i lang="la">status quo</i>, and
hence to the interests of those whom the
<i lang="la">status quo</i> suits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>In the early eighteenth century Bernard
Mandeville revived and elaborated the
doctrine of Thrasymachus. Society was
devised by skilful politicians for their
own advantage. This they hoped chiefly
to secure by the spread of what was
called morality. Addressing themselves,
therefore, to men’s pride, they pointed
out that man had always considered himself
to be superior to the brute beasts.
Yet, if he indulged his passions as soon
as he conceived them and gave way alike
to sensual desire and violent rage, wherein
did his superiority consist? Surely in
order to demonstrate their superiority
men must learn to master their appetites
and restrain their passions. The plain
man listened to the words of the flatterer,
and, aspiring to live the higher life,
transformed himself from a savage into
a clerk. The process is known as civilization.</p>

<p>Tamed by his own conceit, man was
now fit to live in society. As a social
animal he regards as virtuous every
action on the part of others by which the
society to which he belongs is benefited,
and stigmatizes as vicious the indulgence
of private appetites irrespective of the
public good.</p>

<p>But the skilful politicians who had
planned the thing from the beginning
had taken good care to ensure that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
good of society should be identical with
their own advantage. Uncivilized man is
ungovernable man, but man tamed and
tractable, with the bees of social virtue
and social service buzzing in his citizen’s
bonnet, is at once the prop and the dupe
of unscrupulous governments. “From
which”, as Mandeville says, “it is evident
that the first rudiments of morality
broached by skilful politicians to make men
useful to each other as well as tractable,
were chiefly contrived that the ambitious
might reap the more benefit from, and
govern vast numbers of them with the
greater ease and security.”</p>

<p>To those who object that morality was
invented by God and not by politicians,
and that the sanctions of right conduct are
derived not from social utility but from
divine ordinance, it should be observed
that God himself is the most potent
instrument yet devised for securing the
performance of conduct beneficial to the
stronger. This at least is true of the
great bulk of the gods who have figured in
history. On this point perhaps it would
be best to let the stronger speak for
themselves. Napoleon may be taken as a
suitable representative.</p>

<p>“What is it,” he writes, “that makes
the poor man think it quite natural that
there are fires in my parlour while he is
dying of cold? That I have ten coats in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
my wardrobe while he goes naked? That
at each of my meals enough is served to
feed his family for a week? It is simply
religion which tells him that in another
life I shall be only his equal, and that he
actually has more chances of being happy
there than I. Yes, we must see to it that
the floors of the churches are open to all,
and that it does not cost the poor man
much to have prayers said on his tomb.”
Thenceforward, though an avowed free
thinker, Napoleon set his face sternly
against anti-Christian and anti-clerical
legislation.</p>

<p>The moral is sufficiently obvious.
Men whose lives are miserable and
oppressed will either rise in revolt against
their misery and servitude, or console
themselves with the prospect of generous
compensation hereafter. If steps are
taken to ensure that their faith is sufficiently
lively, they will look to the next
world to supply them with the divine
equivalents of the champagne and cigars
they are missing in this one, an expectation
which confers obvious advantages
upon those whom it enables to monopolize
the champagne and cigars. Tack on the
further belief that riches and power in this
world are the best guarantees of torment
and anguish in the next, and the utility of
religion to “the stronger” is sufficiently
manifest. The parable of the needle’s eye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and the story of Lazarus have been responsible
for a political and social quietism
among the many, which do credit to the
political acumen of the early governing
class realists who slipped them into the
text of the New Testament; and whenever
that quietism has showed signs of
giving, way, a religious revival or the
endowment of a church has usually been
found the most effective method of dealing
with the situation.</p>

<p>“In 1818 one Englishman out of seven
being at that time a pauper, Parliament
voted a million of public money for the
construction of churches to preach submission
to the higher powers. In the
debates in the House of Lords, Lord
Liverpool took occasion to lay stress on
the social importance of guiding by this
means the opinions of the masses who
were for the first time beginning to receive
education.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> God, it seems, is cheaper
than a living wage, and no less effective
as a means of securing social contentment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> <cite>The Town Labourer</cite>, by J. L. and Barbara
Hammond.</p>

</div>

<p>To its superior utility in this respect
we must in part attribute the success of
Christianity. Of all religions known to
man it lays the greatest stress upon those
virtues whose practice is advantageous to
the stronger. It glorifies weakness and
sentimentalizes over failure; its heaven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
is for the submissive and the inefficient;
its hell for the dominant and the proud.
Just as the charitable worker takes the
revolutionary edge off poverty by distributing
coal and blankets to the victims
of acute industrial distress, so the priest
promotes submissiveness by inculcating
the duties of sobriety, meekness, unselfishness,
honesty, and contentment. These
virtues make good workmen and prosperous
employers, and, if they are only
developed to a sufficient degree, will
enable their fortunate possessors cheerfully
to put up with bad wages, long hours,
wretched houses, and social servitude. The
contrary virtues of manliness, self-reliance
and independence springing from a spirit
passionately resentful of injustice, quick
to resist an injury and idealistically
determined to make a better place of this
world instead of waiting passively for the
next one, are discouraged as savouring of
pride and self-sufficiency, and as showing
a reprehensible tendency to look for help
to oneself instead of to God, our helper
in time of trouble. The rich, to be sure,
possess these virtues; but then the
message of religion is <em>from</em>, not <em>to</em>, the
rich.</p>

<p>But Thrasymachus has yet one more
observation to make to us before we leave
him to turn to the future. The penalty
of law breaking on a small scale is prison,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
and of trivial wickedness, social ostracism.
But what of law-breaking on a large scale,
and a wickedness powerful enough to flout
the public opinion to which others succumb?
These are the qualities of the
stronger and they reap the stronger’s reward.
The rebel is the patriot who fails,
the patriot is the rebel who prevails. This
is the lesson of the past, and those who
read it may learn that if only they are
strong enough to succeed, they need not
trouble themselves about the respectability
of their credentials. Nor has the position
altered to-day. The man who steals a leg
of mutton goes to prison for a month;
the captain of industry grown rich on the
profits stolen from his workmen gets a
knighthood. The man who has murdered
the wife who has annoyed him gets hanged
for his pains; the man who kills his fellow
men for nourishment is denounced as a
cannibal; but the great general who plans
the death of vast multitudes of his fellows
whom he has never seen, with whom he has
never exchanged a cross word and whom
he does not require for purposes of sustenance,
is hailed as the saviour of his country.</p>

<p>Thus those who commit injustice, yet
have the wit or the good fortune to escape
the consequences of their actions, climb
into the seats of the stronger and share
their immunity from moral restrictions.
Since, in the mere process of gratifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
their tastes, they are enabled to give employment
to large bodies of their fellows,
they are accounted public benefactors
whose wealth constitutes a social asset.
And, should vestiges of the morality of
the weaker, from whose ranks they have
risen, assail them in the form of conscience,
they discover that even the gods can be
squared and that a liberal support of
deserving charities, coupled with the
occasional endowment of a church, are
calculated—so they are assured—to procure
for them as honoured a place in the
hereafter as their own successful injustice
has obtained for them in the present.</p>

<p>Thus Thrasymachus’ phrase “morality
is the interest of the stronger” has a
double significance. In the first place,
it defines the morality of the many as
that kind of conduct which promotes the
interest of the few; in the second, it
assures to the successful few the honourable
reputation, the social consideration
and the good repute among their fellows,
which are commonly supposed to be the
rewards of morality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<small><span class="smcap">Herd Morality and the New
Tyranny of Thought</span></small></h2>
</div>


<p>The statement of general principles in
the preceding chapter was not undertaken
solely for the pleasure of political and
ethical speculation. My concern is a more
practical one. If the principle that
justice is the interest of the stronger is
the explanation of what passes for morality,
what, I wish to ask, is its application
in the present and what is it likely to be
in the immediate future?</p>

<p>In order to answer these questions we
must first consider a further one: Who
in a modern community is the stronger?</p>

<p>The fact that we are a democracy has
not escaped notice. In our own day it is
not kings, nobles, soldiers, prelates,
politicians, or elected persons who are
the stronger, but the common man, the
plain man, the average man, the man in
the street, whether city man or working
man, and the crowd or herd of such men.
He, or rather his female counterpart
since she is more numerous even than he
is, is the arbiter of morality, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
kind of conduct which is called moral
is that which is convenient or pleasing
to her.</p>

<p>Plato with his usual acumen foresaw
the possibility of this development, and
was careful to provide for it within the
bounds of Thrasymachus’ formula. All
that it is necessary to do if we wish to
apply the formula to a democracy is to
invert it; for ‘stronger’ read ‘weaker’,
and the formula remains unaltered. The
practicability of this inversion is demonstrated
by one Callicles, in the Dialogue
called <cite>Gorgias</cite>. Most men are stupid,
irresolute, apathetic, mediocre, timid, and
unimaginative. The qualities implied by
these epithets, though discernible at all
times, force themselves most pressingly
upon the attention when men act together.
Take a sheep and stand it on its hind
legs and its resemblance to a human
being is scarcely noticeable; but stand
a flock of sheep on their hind legs and,
so far as psychology and behaviour go,
you have a crowd of men. In other
words, taken severally men may be
individuals; taken together they are a mere
transmitting medium for herd emotion.
Their individual stupidities are added
together, but their individual wisdoms
cancel out.</p>

<p>In a democracy, says Callicles, the
common men are the more numerous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
they also possess the power; acting,
therefore, in accordance with their natures,
they make the laws which their natures
demand. Now it is natural for every man
to wish to obtain as much as he can. It
is also inevitable that in a state of nature
the stronger should obtain more than the
weaker. Hence the weaker, acting in self-defence,
so frame the laws that the
endeavour of one individual to obtain more
than the many is stigmatized as unjust.
Hence justice, or morality, which is now
revealed as the interest of the individually
weaker but collectively stronger, may be
regarded as their device for depriving the
stronger of the preponderance of good
things, which the strongers’ superior talents
would naturally procure for them.</p>

<p>What we may call herd morality is,
therefore, a form of self-defence dictated
partly by fear, and partly by envy.
The source of the fear is obvious; the
envy springs from the natural spite
of inferior persons who are conscious of
their inferiority, resent it, and wish to
take it out of those who make them feel
it. “I have not,” says the average man,
“the capacity of the strong man for
acquiring a large share of the good things
of life. Therefore I will take advantage
of my numbers to lay it down that such
acquisition is wrong and unjust.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
common view of self-denial may be taken
as an illustration. The average man has
neither the courage nor the strength to
satisfy his desires and indulge his passions.
Being unaccustomed to moderation he
thinks that if he permits himself any
indulgence he will be unable to stop. He
dare not bend for fear he break. Hence
for the Greek virtue of temperance we
get the modern praise of self-denial, with
a resultant standard of morality which
denounces all bodily indulgence as wrong.
Upon the basis of this standard of morality
the principle of sour grapes proceeds to
operate on a large scale. The man who is
not rash enough to take sexual pleasure
when he finds it, the woman who is not
attractive enough to have the opportunity
of being rash, combine to denounce the
delights at which the independent and
the charming are not afraid to grasp.</p>

<p>Herd morality, which is based on fear
and envy, is made effective by blame.
In modern society the power to blame
is chiefly expressed in two ways. First,
by the old whose morality consists in
blaming the young; secondly, by the
average whose censure descends upon the
exceptional.</p>

<p>Upon the part played by the old in
maintaining morality I do not wish to
dwell, since it differs little to-day from
what it has always been. A mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
which all societies have made is to entrust
the management of their affairs to the
old. Old men are naturally more vindictive,
bad tempered, malevolent, and
narrow-minded than young ones. They
are easily provoked to disapproval, and
dislike more things than they like. Having
for the most part lived their own lives,
they have nothing left to do but to interfere
in the lives of others. They form the
governments, misrepresent the people
whom they oppress, preach to the people
whom they exploit, and teach the people
whom they deceive. They mete out
rewards and punishments, sentence
criminals to death, direct businesses,
make laws which they have no temptation
to disobey and wars in which they do not
propose to fight. If the country were
handed over exclusively to the governance
of men under thirty-five, and everybody
over that age were forbidden to interfere
on pain of being sent to the lethal chamber,
it would be a happier and a better place.
Unfortunately the young men are too
busy trying to make a living in the
subordinate positions to which the old
men grudgingly admit them to have the
time or energy to interfere with other
people. Besides, being young, they wish
to live, a process for which the regulation
of the lives of others is a poor substitute.</p>

<p>In the sphere of morality the function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of the old is confined to discovering
methods of deterring the young from
pleasures of which they themselves are
no longer capable. Old men give young
men good advice, no longer being able to
give them bad examples, and old women
invent a symbolic Mrs. Grundy to intimidate
their daughters into resisting the
temptations which now pass them by.
The deterrent influences so exercised
are called morality under which name
they impose on the young who will not
have caught their elders lying often enough
to disbelieve them, until they have begun
to produce sons and daughters of their
own, by which time they will be only too
ready to abet the prevailing hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The other strand in the fabric of modern
morality has already been noticed as the
tendency of the weaker to get even with
the stronger by taking it out of him on
moral grounds. Morals, it is thought,
are everybody’s privilege and everybody’s
possession. Few of us can understand
Einstein’s theory of relativity, but we
all know the difference between right and
wrong. Hence the man who is deficient
in talent can make up for it in virtue,
and by assuring himself that God’s
noblest work is an honest man, put brains
and capacity in their proper place.</p>

<p>Since the motives which have prompted
its invention persist unchanged, morality,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
which has always been the special emanation
of the herd, varies little in spite of
superficial differences from age to age,
whilst intellectuality throws off new
lights in every age. There is probably
very little difference between the crowds
of ancient Babylon and modern Clapham,
but the mind of Einstein differs in radical
particulars from that of Archimedes.</p>

<p>Realizing that any fool can be good
intellectuals have always made light of
morality for the same reasons as those
which have caused the herd to set store
by it. If the herd has been ready to
censure the eccentrics, the eccentrics
have been even readier to provide materials
for censure. Despising the mob, they
flout their standards and laugh at their
scruples. The good are so harsh to the
clever, the clever so rude to the good,
that one might almost be tempted to
believe in a fundamental antipathy between
virtue and brains. Whether this
be so or not, it seems probable that there
is a permanent necessity in our natures
requiring us to exalt the common qualities
we share and understand, and to condemn
rare gifts. Thus morality represents the
average man’s attempt to console himself
in the face of the insulting superiority
of the few, by proving that the superiority
is achieved only at the cost of loss of
virtue. Certainly we must take it out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
these fellows somehow! It tortures our
self-respect to admire those who have
qualities we cannot possess. That is why
we love to think of the philosopher as an
absent-minded fool, incapable of feeding
himself, writing cheques or catching trains,
and listen so greedily to the legends of
vice and voluptuousness in men of
genius.</p>

<p>Wickedness in high places is so much
more appetizing than wickedness in low;
it enables us to prove that those who are
inconsiderate enough to rise above us
in place and power, only do so at the
cost of falling below us in simplicity and
virtue. The public lips have recently
been smacking over the details of a case
in which it was alleged that a wife
endeavoured to advance the career of her
husband by a liaison with the Quarter
Master General of H.M. Forces. It was
further alleged that the husband condoned
and even encouraged her conduct.
The Quarter Master General was a man
of marked ability. His organizing and
administrative capacity were justly
famous; he was, in fact, one of the few
brilliant successes of the War. When the
rumour spread that this man, one of the
most powerful as well as the ablest in
the land, had been willing to advance
a subordinate because he desired his
wife, the outburst of public indignation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
in the press was tremendous. Wickedness
in high places was a glorious theme:
there had been nothing like it since the
Armistice. Labour bodies met to insist
on the superior purity of the lives of working-people,
and parsons thundered in
their pulpits against the luxury of the
rich. For several weeks the Dennistoun
case was the chief subject of conversation
in trains, ’buses, and bar-parlours, and
those whose lips smacked the most
greedily over the luscious scandal were
the most severe in their condemnation of
the vices of society.</p>

<p>Why was it that this case attracted so
much attention? Why was the wickedness
involved considered so shocking? Why
did those who would not have looked
twice at the six-line paragraph describing
a similar occurrence in the remoter
suburbs, follow every detail of the case
with the most avid curiosity? Because
the woman was unusually beautiful, the
man unusually powerful and talented.
The beauty of the woman aroused the
envy of other women; the power and
talents of the man excited the envy of
other men.</p>

<p>We all of us have an impulse to blame
those whom life has more generously
gifted or more fortunately bestowed
than ourselves. We make a virtue of our
deficiencies, argue that only the dull and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
lowly are good, and call the feeling of
envy which we experience for those
who are neither dull nor lowly moral
indignation.</p>

<p>In addition to the envy of the old for
the young and of the herd for the exceptional,
the impulse to blame, which men
call morality, owns another source. This
is the desire for uniformity. The desire
for uniformity springs in its turn from
the fear of insecurity. Society, said
Schopenhauer, is like a collection of
hedgehogs driven together for the sake
of warmth. The object of social
observances is to put felt upon the spikes
in order that the proximity of the hedgehogs
may not cause them to injure one
another. The risk of friction will be
reduced to a minimum if all the hedgehogs
behave in the same way. Identical
behaviour in all circumstances is, no
doubt, an unattainable ideal; but this
makes it doubly important that the herd
as a whole should know within limits
in what way each of its members <em>will</em>
behave. Those who react unexpectedly
to familiar situations, or differ markedly
in their conduct from others are a danger
to the herd, causing social friction and
a sense of insecurity. For this reason
reformers like Christ or Ibsen, who
violently question the standards of thought
and conduct prevalent in their herd, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
refuse to conform to them, are regarded
with bitter hostility.</p>

<p>The method by which the herd secures
the uniformity of conduct upon which its
comfort and security depend is the exercise
of social approval and disapproval. In
extreme cases this method is forcibly
employed. The soldier who shows a tendency
to run away under the enemy’s
fire endangers the safety of his fellows.
Steps are accordingly taken to check
this tendency by the pressure of social
disapproval in the form of discipline.
Discipline is a device for substituting the
certainty of being shot for those who
do not go over the top for the probability
of being shot for those who do. The
result is that most soldiers go over the
top. This is conduct conducive to the
safety of the herd, and is rewarded with
social approval under the name of courage.</p>

<p>More usually social approval and disapproval
find expression in the sphere
of manners and modes. In Japan under
the old laws the term for a rude man is
“other-than-expected fellow”, and a noble
is not to be interfered with in cutting
down a fellow who has behaved to him
in a manner other than is expected.
In general, thought or conduct calculated
to surprise or disturb the herd incurs
disapproval and is called immoral;
thought and conduct which mirrors the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
beliefs and habits of the herd is regarded
with approval and is called moral. Thus
virtue is the habit of acting in a manner
of which other people approve; vice in a
manner of which they disapprove.</p>

<p>Summing up, therefore, we may say
that social morality in a democracy
springs from the envy of the average man
for the talents of the able man which
cause him to feel inferior, and from the
dislike of the herd for the conduct of the
eccentric which makes it feel unsafe.</p>

<p>These are general principles and are
more or less applicable in any state of
society which is not a tyranny or a close
oligarchy. What I wish to emphasize
is their special application to a modern
western democracy.</p>

<p>In a community of this type the herd
is at once more congested and more
powerful than it has been in any other
period of history. Its congestion causes
it to place a hitherto unparalleled emphasis
upon the necessity for felting the spikes
of the hedgehogs, that is to say, upon
the importance of uniformity; its power
enables it to vent its disapproval upon
those who offend its prejudices with the
maximum effect. This can be seen most
clearly in the case of America which
has produced the most congested<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
most powerful herd on record. America
is a melting pot in which all the races of
the earth are fused. The natural diversity
of its elements produces a special need
for artificial uniformity in its citizens.
A civilization with its roots in the earth
can allow its members to spread outwards,
like the branches of a tree; a civilization,
whose seeds are planted in shallow soil,
must hedge them about lest they be scattered
by the wind. The first is centrifugal:
it can tolerate individuality because it
has a centre. The second is centripetal:
it must enforce uniformity because it has
none.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The word ‘congested’ is used to denote the
oppression of spiritual stuffiness rather than of
physical overcrowding.</p>

</div>

<p>For this reason all American citizens
strive to be exactly like each other, and,
on the whole, they succeed. They have
the same clothes, they live in the same
houses, they have the same social habits,
the same respect for money and the same
suspicion of such superfluous eccentricities
as thought, culture, and art.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, who had wintered
in a Southern State, as the season
advanced discarded his felt hat for the
regulation straw. A few weeks later he
had occasion to travel northwards to
New York. As he left the train he noticed
that he was an object of attention to
people on the platform. Porters and
loungers stared, and as he walked away
from the station, he found himself followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
by a small and apparently hostile crowd.
Hailing a taxi, he drove to his hotel. In
the porch he met an acquaintance, told
him of the notice he had attracted, and
asked the reason. His friend explained
the matter by pointing to his straw hat.
It was too early in New York for the
change over into straws, he said, and of
course one could not dress differently
from other people.</p>

<p>The rigid enforcement of uniformity
is hostile not only to freedom of action
but also to independence of thought. The
laws against teaching or holding doctrines
displeasing to the majority are particularly
severe in America. Immigrants, for example,
are not allowed to land in America until
they have first expressed their disbelief in
Communism, atheism, and free love. Many
people are put in prison for holding unpopular
views, although these views do no
apparent harm to anybody. Advocacy
of birth-control, possession of irreverent
and disreputable books such as <cite>Jurgen</cite>,
expression of subversive opinions with
regard to the relationship of capital and
labour, and disbelief in God are among the
offences so punished.</p>

<p>Not only is it necessary not to profess
unpopular views—it is sometimes necessary
to profess popular ones. In order
to placate herd opinion it is found
necessary to enforce by law the propagation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of deliberate falsehood. This happens
especially in those cases, unfortunately
only too numerous, in which the truth
is less gratifying to human conceit than
we could wish, so that its adoption
involves the abandonment of cherished
beliefs. Such, for instance, is the belief
that man is a degenerate angel, which is
thought to be more flattering than the
truth that he is a promoted ape. Thus
the State of Tennessee has recently
officially repudiated the “monkey ancestry”
of its citizens. A law has been
passed under which it is illegal for
any teacher in a university or other public
school to teach anything denying the
story of creation given in the Bible, or
that man has descended from the
lower order of animals, and men have
already been imprisoned for teaching
evolution. It is not, so far as I know,
maintained even in America that the
doctrine of evolution is untrue. It is
sufficient that it incurs the disapproval of
the stronger. Thus truth herself is liable
to be stigmatized as immoral if she is
inconsiderate enough to flout the wishes of
respectable citizens.</p>

<p>Where individuality is to a large extent
obliterated, and citizens are cut according
to approved specification by the social
machine, nothing is so much valued as
personality. I have said that every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
American wishes to be like every other
American, and so he does—but with a
difference. He wants to have a personality
of his own. He wishes to have a something
about him that will convey an impression
of uniqueness and cause him to be talked
about among his fellows. Nothing is so
much discussed in America as personality.
Men try to cultivate it as they try to
cultivate biceps; agencies exist in order
to tell you how to be unique, and psycho-analysts
flourish by the simple process of
telling you that you are unique.</p>

<p>But this is just what the conditions upon
which herd morality depends will not let
you be. Depart one hair’s-breadth from
the standard habits of thought and accepted
codes of conduct, and the herd will make
your existence intolerable until you consent
to toe the line.</p>

<p>Now the drift of British development
follows increasingly the course set by
America. America is our most advanced
nation in morals as in everything else, and,
if we want to know what England will be
like to-morrow, we cannot do better than
look at America to-day. America is
at once a signpost and a stimulus. What
American business men are, that do our
business men strive humbly to be. They
ape their magnificence, and enjoy a
large and increasing share of this power.
The stockbroker’s conception of the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
life is becoming increasingly accepted by
the clerk, the clerk’s by the shopkeeper,
the shopkeeper’s by the workman, so that
the community as a whole is doing its best
to live up to the standard which its
business men set. So soon as we have
got rid of the last vestiges of our dying
aristocracy, such as respect for hunting
and a semi-feudal tenantry, we shall
subside into an inferior and imitative
satellite of the States.</p>

<p>The objects of American civilization
are to substitute cleanliness for beauty,
mechanism for men, and hypocrisy for
morals. It devotes so much energy to
obtaining the means to make life possible,
that it has none left to practise the art
of living. Hot baths and more hot baths,
larger and ever larger hotels, faster and
ever faster cars, golf played by ever fatter
and more vulgar men, and lap-dogs kept
by ever fatter and more vulgar women,
cocktails and culture, psycho-analysis
and faith healing, sensual poetry and
sensational sport, supported and maintained
by an illiterate governing class
ready to be imposed upon by any quack
or charlatan who can persuade it to take
an interest in what it imagines to be
its soul, such is the probable development
of bourgeois civilization in England.</p>

<p>Hints of the growing adhesion of the herd
to the ideals and pursuits of big business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
are not wanted in current developments
of moral sentiment. As the profiteer
supplants the aristocrat as the dominant
force in the community, a slight twist
is given to the moral opinions of the herd
as a whole in order that they may be
brought into line with the changed interests
of the stronger. Moral sentiments
suitable to the interests of a hereditary
aristocracy of landed proprietors insensibly
give place to a morality designed to protect
and safeguard the pursuits of the fat man
on holiday.</p>

<p>An example of this process is afforded
by the changed attitude to hunting. A
hundred years ago hunting was considered
an entirely honourable pursuit, appropriate
to gentlemen and advantageous to the
countryside. To-day it is attacked on
humanitarian grounds and voices are
raised in favour of the fox. If he must
be killed why not humanely? It was
recently reported that a fox chased by
the Cowdray hounds jumped through
the window of a private residence
and up the chimney flue. Efforts were
made to smoke him out by lighting a
fire immediately below, for all the world
as if he were a boy chimney brush of a
century ago instead of a fox, but they
were unsuccessful. Ultimately workmen
removed some bricks and the fox was got
out and given to the hounds. This case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
caused an outcry on the ground that the
fox, who had given the hounds a good run,
was the victim of cruel and unsporting
conduct. A similar outburst was provoked
by a hunted stag who recently took refuge
in the Channel, and was picked up and
carried to France.</p>

<p>That hunting is now condemned by the
moral sense of the community not because
of any increase in humanitarian sentiment,
but because of a change in the interests of
the predominant herd, is shown by the
apathy of public opinion with regard to
the victims of the gun and the motor.
Business men unable to hunt because of
the obesity produced by their habits are
not debarred from shooting. Moors are
hired in Scotland and all creatures liable
to interfere with the supply of game are
ruthlessly exterminated. Thus a squirrel-catching
society has recently been formed
in Aberdeenshire. Rewards are offered
for each squirrel captured, and it is
estimated that between two and three
thousand squirrels are killed a year. At
Monte Carlo business-men sit on terraces
and shoot down pigeons which have been
previously imprisoned in darkened boxes,
with the result that, when they are let
out into the sunlight, they are too dazed
to fly away. Before they are placed in the
boxes the tails of these birds are removed.
This impedes their flight and makes things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
easier for the business-men, who kill
between sixty and a hundred an hour.
But it is not thought, except by cranks,
that the business-men are immoral for
amusing themselves in this way, although
it is illegal in England for boys to steal
the eggs of many kinds of birds.</p>

<p>In the south of England, where the roads
are tarred to facilitate the passage of
motors and the approach of business-men
is heralded over the countryside by a
stink of tar and petrol, it is reported that
the emanations from the roads have
poisoned the waters of the Test and
Itchen and caused the death of many of
the living things that dwell in them. Even
the fish, it seems, have begun to feel the
march of progress.</p>

<p>Motors are frequently the cause of the
death to hens, puppies, cats, and small
children. Yet nobody thinks the business
man’s pursuit of motoring immoral. On
the contrary, it is assumed without
question that the road is his property,
and that the pedestrian should make way
for him, while the risk to life and damage
to limb consequent upon his refusal to do
so are regarded as the results of culpable
folly and negligence on the part not of the
motorist but of himself.</p>

<p>Business-men are given to amassing
property, but not to making friends. It is
not in personal relationships that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
seek the good life, but in a plenitude of
goods. For this reason current herd
morality visits offences against property
with greater severity than offences against
the person. A man will get six months
for stealing a diamond necklace, but only
six days for beating his wife. But,
though the ill treatment of a wife by her
husband is punished with comparative
lightness, her appropriation by another
man is considered to be the height of
wickedness. This is because the man who
makes love to his neighbour’s wife is
committing an offence against property.
For the same reason the desire on the part
of a wife to secede from her existing
possessor and to be an independent
entity maintaining herself by her own
exertions is regarded with disfavour.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It
is as if a valuable house were to insist that
it should remain uninhabited.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Cp. the success of A. S. M. Hutchinson’s
<cite>This Freedom</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p>Those who belong to a herd are in
general unable to understand the wish
of others to escape from it. Such a wish
is an implied criticism upon the herd conception,
and brings a sense of insecurity.
Thus the desire for leisure and solitude,
or for a life amid wild surroundings, is
regarded with instinctive disapproval.
A Frenchman recently exploring in Brazil
came upon a party of Indians one of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
had a paler skin than the others. The
pale skinned Indian turned out to be his
long-lost brother, who had lived among
the Indians for a number of years. The
explorer immediately set to work to
persuade his brother to return with him
to civilization. His efforts, however,
proved unavailing. The brother asked
why he should return to a community in
which he had to pay taxes, wear clothes
and do other disagreeable things, when he
could live with the Indians in a state of
nature without labour of any kind. The
explorer had no answer to these questions.
He was unable to understand this refusal
to return to the herd and accept the
restrictions that existence in the herd
involves. Accordingly he told his brother
that he was a hopeless degenerate, and
left him to what he characteristically
called his fate.</p>

<p>Something of the same feeling is
entertained by the average man towards
the artist or the writer. He distrusts the
contempt of herd standards which his
irregular life implies. This sentiment is
reinforced by a feeling of insecurity in
regard to possessions. The average man
is too busy to spare time for sexual
immorality, and instinctively suspects the
life of the artist or writer because of the
facilities which it accords for meddling with
his wife during office hours. The general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
nature of the objection entertained by the
herd to sexual immorality will be examined
more fully in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Before I close this chapter I wish to
point out how the sentiments I have
endeavoured to describe have been intensified
by the decay of religion.</p>

<p>Communities in which the average man
is the stronger have always been noted
for their Puritanism and high moral
standard. Promiscuity has historically
been practised by the aristocracy rather
than by the middle classes, and in societies
in which the standard is set by the latter
is visited accordingly with a disproportionate
amount of moral obloquy. Severer
steps would no doubt have been taken
against it, had it not been for the conviction
that the sinner would be punished hereafter.
The poor man, lacking the rich
man’s goods, has comforted himself with
the story of Lazarus. But the moral man
has found equal consolation when denying
himself the pleasures of the flesh, in
picturing the eternal torments which
awaited those who refused to be bound by
his inhibitions.</p>

<p>The average moralist has accordingly
refrained from punishing the successful
libertine, knowing that God would do it
for him. But this conviction is no longer
held. God is a much more mysterious
being than he used to be, and we have less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
knowledge of his ways. It may be that he
does not exist at all, and in any event the
belief that he will do this or that, and, in
particular, that he will entertain the same
moral views as we do ourselves, is no
longer entertained with its old time certainty.
“Vengeance is mine, saith the
Lord; I will repay.” Perhaps it is, but
it might be visited on the wrong people.
In any event it is safer to take no chances,
and to make sure that sinners shall suffer
in this world the punishment which the
eccentricity of God’s views may permit
them to forego in the next. For this reason
it is to be expected that the herd
morality of the future will develop a
severer outlook upon derelictions from the
standards of behaviour which it regards as
moral. What these derelictions are, and
what are the reasons for supposing that in
spite of this attitude they are likely to increase,
I will consider in the next chapter.</p>

</div>


<p>Important forces are, however, at work
in the contrary direction. If the growing
prevalence of herd morality will tend to
place a new emphasis on the importance
of uniformity, uniformity in the moral
sphere is likely to prove more difficult of
attainment.</p>

<p>Two factors in particular will militate
against it. These are the growth of
economic independence among women,
and the practice of birth control. Let
us consider these factors separately.</p>

<p>I. The basis of the institution of marriage
is economic. Theological factors
have of course played their part. The
early Christian fathers, expecting the
immediate end of the world, saw no reason
to take steps to ensure the continuance
of the race. The Christian hostility to
the pleasures of the senses was, therefore,
allowed to rage unchecked, and sexual
intercourse was denounced as both wicked
and unnecessary. As time passed, however,
it was found that the world showed no
signs of coming to an end, an inconsiderateness
which led to the necessity for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
change of attitude. The Church met the
situation with a complete <i lang="la">volte face</i>. It
had previously stigmatized the sexual
passions as so wicked that no Christian
should be permitted to indulge them:
it now pronounced them to be so sacred
that no Christian should be permitted
to indulge them without the sanction
of the Church. The sanction of the Church
was given in marriage, a device whereby
the Fathers sought to control and to
regulate the workings of a passion they
were unable to ignore. Since then the
Church has claimed both the ability and
the right to sanctify sex, and has looked
with disfavour upon marriages consummated
by the State as an infringement of
her monopoly.</p>

<p>But the fact that marriage has been
instituted by God and cornered by the
Church is not sufficient to account for its
existence before the Christian epoch or its
stability since. These rest upon an
economic foundation.</p>

<p>Throughout the recorded history of
civilization the only recognized way for
a woman to make her living has been
through her body. Her body being her
one saleable asset, she could employ it
in either of two ways. She could sell
the use of it to one man for an indefinite
period, or she could lease it to a number
of men for short and strictly regulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
periods. The first method is known as
marriage; the second as prostitution.
The existence of these two, and of only
these two, ways of gaining an economic
livelihood has led to the formation of
two unofficial women’s Trade Unions, the
Trade Union of wives and the Trade
Union of prostitutes. The strength of
these unions is directly proportional
to their monopoly of the economic field,
and far exceeds that of any recognized
Union in the more strictly industrial
sphere.</p>

<p>It is immediately obvious that any
woman who was prepared to give for
love or for nothing what other women
were only prepared to give for maintenance
was a blackleg of the most
subversive type, and the whole force of
organized female opinion has, therefore,
been devoted to making her position
impossible. The force of female opinion so
directed is known as morality, and the
bitterness with which the free lover, that
is to say, the woman who loves outside
the marriage tie or the prostitute’s preserves,
is denounced as immoral, is due to
woman’s unconscious recognition of the
fact that she is cutting at the basis of the
economic livelihood of her sex.</p>

<p>It is of course true that the two women’s
Unions are to some extent competitive,
and that the existence of the prostitute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
threatens the security of the wife while it
guarantees the chastity of the young
girl. For this reason there is and always
will be hostility between the Unions.
The wife’s first commandment is the
Deity’s “Thou shalt have none other
woman but me”, and she is accordingly
accustomed to regard the prostitute with
horror, whereas she does not object to the
existence of other wives, since this does
not, at least in theory, threaten her own.
For this reason, too, the method of earning
a living adopted by the wife is generally
preferred to that adopted by the prostitute,
and is esteemed the more honourable
by public opinion. So true is this that in
most women the belief in the honourableness
of wifehood has become second
nature, the really nice woman feeling
instinctively that the only decent way for
her to live is on the earnings of some man.
But while this feeling provokes hostility
to members of the other Union, it is a
hostility which cannot compare in bitterness
with the scorn and hatred felt for
the free lover. The reason for this is
obvious. The number of women a man
can have for money is limited by the
extent of his income; the number of
women he can have for nothing is limited
only by the extent of his ability to find
them. For this reason it is felt instinctively
that the free lover is a greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
menace to society than the prostitute.
The prostitute, indeed, is and always has
been recognized as a social necessity.
She guarantees the chastity of nice women
by providing a necessary solace for men
up to the comparatively late age at which
modern economic conditions allow them
to marry. Thus in Tsarist Russia the
brothel was a State-recognized institution.
The new brothel was formally opened by
the police officer, and was hallowed by
a religious ceremony in the course of
which the premises were blessed by a
Russian Orthodox priest.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sexual morality in men springs from
the same economic source, but is more
limited in scope and less fiercely embraced.
This is a natural deduction from what has
just been said. If the livelihood of women
is bound up with the strict observance
of the marriage tie, the maintenance of
the moral restrictions upon which marriage
as an institution depends is their special
concern. In a purely promiscuous community
the livelihood of women would
be intolerably insecure. Hence women are
the natural guardians of morality, knowing
that it guarantees their bread and butter.
It is not too much to say that morality
as a going concern is kept up by women.
Men on the whole, despite their strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
property sense, are not interested in
moral questions. They have not the
woman’s delight in nosing out scandals,
and, except when they are whipped up
into a state of moral horror by their
women folk, are much too prone to live and
let live. The attitude of deliberate
uncharitableness towards erring sisters
which the sex affects does not come
naturally to men, and left to themselves,
they would condone offences which their
outraged spouses insist on punishing with
social ostracism.</p>

<p>It is on the whole true to say that the
moral sense, so far as sex is concerned,
only begins to function in men after
marriage and, except in the case of one’s
own daughter whose saleable value in the
marriage market is thought to be diminished
by inchastity, it centres upon the
wife. Since the wife is in origin a piece of
property purchased by the husband for
his own enjoyment, to her must be
extended the jealous guardianship which
presides over property in general. The
wife is the most valuable of a man’s indoor
possessions; in return for the use of her
body he has agreed to maintain her in
such dignity and leisure as he can afford.
This obligation to maintain the wife is
a permanent one persisting even after
the enjoyment of her person has ceased.
Thus when a wife divorces or lives apart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
from her husband, he is usually required
to maintain her, so long as she remains
chaste. So soon, however, as she bestows
the enjoyment of her person upon another,
the obligation to maintenance ceases,
presumably on the ground that the new
consumer should be saddled with the
obligation of keeping up what he enjoys.
In nothing is the property basis of marriage
more clearly discernible than in the
‘dum casta’ clause of the English divorce
law.</p>

<p>It is upon the same economic basis
that the husband’s objection to infidelity
chiefly rests. If another man is permitted
to enjoy for nothing what he himself
has purchased at a heavy outlay, the
husband naturally feels aggrieved. He
is also rendered ridiculous. It is for
this reason that the cuckold is always
presented in literature as a comic figure;
he is in the position of a man who is
unconsciously having his pocket picked.
The husband’s predilection for fidelity
in the wife is thus as strong as the wife’s
demand for fidelity in the husband—at
times it is even stronger—and springs
from the same economic source. So long as
the wife is in essence a piece of property,
it is naturally felt that only the man who
has paid for her should have the use of
her; so long as a woman can only obtain
her living by selling herself to a man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
she not unnaturally demands that others
should not be allowed to undercut her.</p>

<p>We have spoken of this situation as if
it existed in the present; but it is already
in many respects an affair of the past. The
history of the last fifty years has recorded
the growing and continuous influx of
women into wage-earning employment
which bears no relationship to sex.
Women cure the sick, plead in the law
courts, teach in the schools, do manual
labour in garden, field, factory, and workshop,
and serve increasingly as clerks,
typists and shop assistants. Three were
recently found among the five hundred
applicants for the post of public
executioner in Hungary.</p>

<p>Men have not unnaturally resented
this change. The dependence of women
has on the whole suited them, and they
do not like to see those whose economic
helplessness has made them a natural prey
to male predatoriness rendered capable
of standing on their own feet. Having
deliberately deprived women of the skill,
the training, the knowledge, and the qualifications
necessary to make their way in
the world, men have then proceeded to
justify themselves by proving the moral
and intellectual inferiority of women from
the fact that she is ignorant, unskilled
and uneducated. When it is remembered
that the same causes that have left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
woman no alternative but concubinage
(married or unmarried) or starvation,
have compelled her, as often as not, to
perform the duties of an unpaid housekeeper,
it is not difficult to see how much
man was the gainer by the transaction.
But, unfortunately for him, he has been
unable to stem the rising tide of feminism.
It has long ceased to be true that a
woman’s only means of earning her
living is by exploiting her sex-attraction,
and all the evidence points to the fact
that the number of women in wage-earning
employment will be augmented
in the future. This estimate leaves out
of account the probability of the endowment
of motherhood, which will place
all mothers, whether married or unmarried,
in the category of independent wage-earners.</p>

<p>The effect of this economic change upon
the situation I have briefly sketched,
and upon the moral sentiments to which
it gives rise is likely to be twofold.</p>

<p>In the first place the unmarried woman
will tend increasingly to form temporary,
irregular unions. This result will follow:</p>

<p>(1) Because her knowledge that she
can earn her living in other ways will
not force her to demand from the man a
pledge of life-long maintenance as the
price of her love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>(2) Because knowing that she is not
dependent upon a man for her livelihood,
she will no longer have the incentive to
pander to the man’s demand for virginity
in his prospective wife by remaining
chaste until marriage.</p>

<p>(3) Because a man’s abandonment of
the connection which she has formed
with him, a process commonly known as
desertion, will not as heretofore leave her
stranded without means of support.</p>

<p>(4) Because men will be less chary of
forming temporary, sexual relationships
with women, when they know that they
are not expected to keep them.</p>

<p>In the second place the married woman
will tend to mitigate her hostility to irregular
unions formed by unmarried women
when she realizes:</p>

<p>(1) That her husband’s mistress, not
being dependent upon him for support,
will constitute a less formidable threat to
her livelihood.</p>

<p>(2) That the possible transference of
her husband’s affections and consequent
withdrawal of financial support will not
leave her necessarily incapable of finding
other employment.</p>

<p>(3) That, as the clear-cut line of
demarcation between married and unmarried
unions becomes obscured by the
increase in the number of the latter,
it will no longer be either possible or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
necessary to put the unmarried mistress
as completely beyond the pale of decent
society as has been customary in the
past.</p>

<p>From the above considerations it will be
seen that the growing economic independence
of women is likely, unless counteracted
by other forces, to lead to a relaxation
of the marriage tie, to an increase in
irregular unions, and to a growing tendency
to dispense with marriage altogether.</p>

<p>But, some critics will object, what
about the children? Hitherto, I have
left the children outside the scope of
the argument, and it is high time to
bring them in. This leads me to a consideration
of the second of the two factors
which I cited at the beginning of the
chapter, the practice of birth-control.</p>


<p class="p2">II. That the practice of birth-control
is likely to increase there can, I think, be
no reasonable doubt. I am aware that
there is considerable opposition to birth-control
at the moment, and the various
arguments are brought forward to discourage
people from employing its methods.
These arguments are not held on rational
grounds, but are dictated by prejudices
based on certain religious or political
opinions which those who put them
forward profess. It is said, for example,
that birth-control is displeasing to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Almighty, who invented sexual intercourse
for the reproduction not of pleasure
but of children; and it is thought, though
not said, that it is injurious to the State
because it will diminish the supply of
cannon-fodder and cheap labour.</p>

<p>As regards the Almighty, whether he
would agree with the views put forward by
those who speak in his name is not known.
Until, therefore, we can obtain a direct
expression of his opinion on the matter, it
is more prudent to assume that his
attitude is non-committal, than to supply
the place of knowledge by converting our
conjectures into dogmas. As regards
the supply of cannon-fodder, this is supposed
to be important for consumption
in future wars. Since, however, those
who oppose birth-control on the ground
that it will diminish the number of
recruits, also hold that wars are inevitable
owing to the pressure of expanding populations,
it would seem that populations
which cease to expand have no need to
maintain large armies to protect them
from the results of expansion.</p>

<p>The position of those who oppose birth-control
being based on political and
religious feelings of an emotional character
is not, however, refutable by argument,
or assailable by reason. Our business is
not to reply to arguments which have no
rational basis, but to estimate what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
influence they are likely to have in
the future.</p>

<p>There is, I think, little doubt
that this influence will be a diminishing
one. Much of the opposition to birth-control
is little more than an expression
of the generalized feeling of hostility
which people experience in regard to
anything that is new. Whether it be a
new morality, a new sonata form, a new
way of wearing the hair, a new kind
of corset (or none at all), or a new saviour
of mankind with which he is presented,
man’s natural and instinctive reaction
is one of antagonism. The antagonism
is provoked not by any intrinsic demerit
in the thing that arouses it—indeed in
fifty or a hundred years time it is embraced
with acclamation as the last word in
orthodoxy or good form—but simply
by its newness. The suggestion that any
way of life, of thought or of conduct can be
better than that which they have hitherto
followed wounds people’s self-respect,
and some time must elapse before they
can overlook the offence.</p>

<p>This kind of objection applies in a
marked degree to birth-control which
challenges people’s most intimate habits,
and seems likely to effect a revolution in
their conduct. It will, however, diminish
as the idea of birth-control becomes
familiar. The reaction of the normal
Englishman to that which is new usually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
passes through three phases. He says
first “It is absurd”, second “It is
contrary to Scripture”, and third “Of
course! I knew it all the time”. It will
be seen that the opposition to birth-control
has already passed into the second
phase.</p>

<p>There is a further reason for the probable
weakening of the anti-birth-control movement.
The organized opposition to birth-control
comes very largely from members
of the upper and middle classes. These on
an average have very much smaller
families than the lower classes in whose
interests they profess to oppose birth-control,
and to whom they denounce it.
The inevitable inference from this fact
cannot continue indefinitely to remain
undrawn, and, as soon as it is drawn, the
lower classes will be able to gauge the
sincerity of those who exhort them to
choose between continence or children,
while being themselves remarkable for
neither.</p>

<p>Finally the knowledge of the use of
contraceptives is bound in course of time
to percolate through every social stratum.
The advantages of birth-control to the
individual are so obvious that few will
refuse to avail themselves of the knowledge
which the State, in the persons of
the medical officers in charge of infant
welfare centres, at present withholds;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
while the disadvantages to the community
of a system under which the lower strata
proliferate unchecked, while the upper
and middle classes barely keep up their
numbers, and the exceptional man who
has the talent and energy to climb from
one stratum into another finds it necessary
to sterilize himself in the process, will,
in the shape of a rapidly deteriorating
population, force themselves upon the
notice of even the most pious.</p>

<p>Birth-control has come to stay; it has
also knocked the bottom out of what is
called sexual morality.</p>

<p>If the views put forward in the previous
chapters be correct, if morality is the
interest of the stronger, and if, where the
stronger is the herd of average individuals,
it expresses itself in disapproval
of conduct from which the average, for
whatever reason, shrink, then the driving
force of morality is to be looked for not
in any innate sanction but in the power
which the herd possess of rendering
intolerable the lives of those who flout
its prejudices. But in order that the herd
may be able to exercise this power, it must
be in a position to detect the objects of
its censure. This has been possible in
the past owing to the unfortunate propensity
of sexual irregularity to result in
offspring. It is not easy to disguise the
existence of a child, and, even if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
desperate course of overlaying or otherwise
extinguishing it be adopted, the
disposal of the corpse presents grave
difficulties. Such a course is also open to
the objection of doing grave violence to
the humaner parental instincts. But
birth-control precludes the necessity for
children, and by so doing makes it possible
to “sin” without being found out.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that people
will refuse to avail themselves of the
liberty thereby conferred. Whether we
are to infer that people are by nature
sinful, or simply that a sin which has been
manufactured by herd morality is not
really a sin, is a question that does not
immediately concern us. What does
concern us is the impetus which this
ability to avoid detection is likely to give
to irregular intercourse. Birth-control
combined with economic independence
has brought a new freedom to women.
Economic independence enables them to
have children without going either to the
altar or into the workhouse. The practice
of birth-control makes it unnecessary even
to have the children.</p>

<p>One further result of birth-control may
be noticed before we pass on. This is the
probable abolition of the double standard
of morality for men and women after
marriage. That adultery in a wife has
always been considered to be more serious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
than adultery in the husband the state
of the law bears witness. Adultery in a
wife is a sufficient cause for divorce, in a
husband it<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> must be coupled with cruelty
or desertion. This disparity of treatment
has always caused grave offence to feminist
organizations. Yet the reason for the
difference is not far to seek. It arises
from the economic dependence of the wife
upon the husband. As the result of this
dependence any children which the wife
may acquire in the course of her adventures
become a charge upon the husband, who
is thus required to pay for the fruits of
his own shame and another’s enjoyment.
It is true that he is, or ought to be,
similarly responsible for the upkeep of the
offspring which may result from his own
adultery, but in this case he has at
least had his pleasure and sinned his sin,
and cannot in justice complain if his
substance is consumed by its fruits.
Where, however, adultery on the part of
the wife does not carry with it a risk of
children to be maintained by the husband,
it becomes an offence neither more nor
less serious than adultery on the part of
the husband, and the double standard
ceases accordingly to operate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> In July, 1923, the law was amended and
adultery in the husband became a sufficient ground
of divorce.</p>

</div>

<p>As a result of the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
considerations we may expect that the
practice of birth-control will profoundly
modify our sexual habits. It will enable
the pleasures of sex to be tasted without
its penalties, and it will remove the most
formidable deterrent to irregular intercourse.</p>

<p>It is this consideration which lies at the
root of the opposition to birth-control.
Deep down in most of us there lurks something
of the old Puritanical attitude, which
insists that pleasure cannot or should not
be had without paying for it. This at
least is true of pleasures we do not share.
And it is this sentiment which is outraged
by the immunity from the consequences
of sexual pleasure which birth-control
confers. The Puritans objected to bear
baiting not so much because of the pain
which it gave to the bear, as because of
the pleasure which it gave to the spectators.
In the same way the great mass of
decent middle class citizens object to birth-control
not because of the evil which it
does to the race, but because of the pleasure
which it gives to those who practice it. The
Puritans are up in arms; the dowagers,
the aunts, the old maids, the parsons, the
town councillors, the clerks, the members
of Vigilance Committees and Purity
Leagues, all those who are themselves too
old to enjoy sex, too unattractive to
obtain what they would wish to enjoy, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
too respectable to prefer enjoyment to
respectability—in a word, the makers of
public opinion—are outraged in their
deepest feelings by the prospect of shameless,
harmless and unlimited pleasure
which birth-control offers to the young.
And if they can stop it it will be stopped.</p>

<p>Hence concurrently with the increased
freedom which economic independence
and birth-control will give to young
people, and to young women in particular,
there is likely to be a growth in restrictive
and purely inhibitory morality on the part
of the middle-aged.</p>

<p>We are in, then, for a wave of Puritanism
on the one hand combined with the
possibility of a new liberty of action on
the other. What will be the outcome?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small><span class="smcap">The Coming Clash</span></small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before I endeavour to answer the
question with which I concluded the last
chapter, there are one or two additional
considerations to which it is necessary to
refer, since they must affect our estimate
of the future.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the possibility of a new
freedom for women due to birth-control
and economic independence. Other factors
are likely to make such freedom more
imperative on social grounds and less
intimidating on moral ones.</p>

<p>The first is the great and growing preponderance
of women in the community.
It is estimated that in Great Britain there
are already two million more women than
men, and the figures can no doubt be
paralleled from other Western European
countries. Our present moral code condemns
these two million, and as many more
as the number of bachelors involves, to
perpetual celibacy and sterility. In other
words one woman out of every ten is
expected to deny herself the right to
motherhood or to become an outcast
from decent society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>This system is intolerable; it is manifestly
breaking down in many directions,
and it continues at all only because public
opinion among women is still too unorganized
to protest against it. It is
already the subject of wholesale disregard
and infringement in practice, and it will
be abolished in theory as soon as the
social sense of the community has progressed
to the point of removing the
stigma from illegitimacy and the reproach
from unmarried motherhood. In other
words the system is bound up with the
man-made convention which insists that
the right to have a child shall be saddled
with the duty of looking after a man, and,
since there are not enough men to go round,
women will sooner or later be forced in
self-defence to permit themselves to have
children without husbands.</p>

<p>So far as the right to sexual experience,
independently of the right of motherhood,
is concerned, this is already safeguarded
by birth-control. The growing surplus
of women will tend, therefore, through
the sheer pressure of virginity, to promote
an increase in irregular relationships, and
to reinforce the movement towards freedom
already described.</p>

<p>Nor will religious considerations deter
with their traditional force. I have
already spoken of the decline of religious
sentiment in connection with the growth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
of moral rigour in the herd. Lacking
the conviction that God will punish
wrong-doers, they arrogate the right to
themselves. But the same scepticism
which lights the fires of the heresy-hunters
encourages the wickedness of the heretics.
If marriages were not made by God, and
torment in hell is probably not the
result of adultery, there is no longer
reason to think that five minutes’ bliss
must be paid for in terms of eternal
damnation. It is, no doubt, true, that God
still loves the pure, but when earthly
lovers are available, the price of God’s
love may be not worth the paying. Hence
the religious argument, though doubtless
it will operate as a brake in a diminishing
number of cases, will no longer act as a
wholesale deterrent.</p>

<p>A more serious consideration is put
forward in the name of biology. “You
are,” the biologist will point out, “conducting
your argument on the basis of
certain assumptions with regard to the
nature of women, since you predict an
increase in sexual irregularity not only
among men, but also, and inevitably,
among women. Men, it is agreed, are
regrettably promiscuous, in the sense that,
even if they are monogamous in fact,
they are varietist by inclination. But
women are different. Their nature is not
varietist but monogamous, and it will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
in spite of all changes of material circumstances
and moral sentiments, remain so.
For this reason irregular sexual unions
will not increase in the manner you
predict.”</p>

<p>Biological arguments of this type,
derived from the alleged nature of women,
are in my view mere man-made superstitions.
The particular argument in
question was invented by the peccant
male who wished to convince himself
that, however flagrant his own infidelities,
his wife would remain faithful because it
was her nature. The superstition was also
useful, because it implied that, although
a life of unvarying fidelity might do
violence to his natural proclivities, he
need suffer no qualm of conscience in
expecting and exacting conduct which he
repudiated for himself from his monogamous
wife. The notion too was flattering
and appealed readily to male conceit.</p>

<p>Now as to the existence of the facts
asserted by my imaginary biologist, there
is, I imagine, little doubt. There are, of
course, countless exceptions either way,
but the general tendency is not obscure.
While the cases of My Lord and the
barmaid are legion, those of My Lady and
the groom are notoriously few. But
admitting the fact, are we to regard it as
necessarily unalterable? Many, I know,
are inclined to do so. Contemplating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
domestic tragedies springing from the
nomadic tendencies of the male, they have
seen in them one more piece of evidence
for the satirical plan on which they believe
the Universe to have been constructed.
If indeed there be design in the scheme of
things, to what sort of design do the facts
point? To have made man polygamous
and woman monogamous they regard as
God’s worst practical joke, and conclude
that, whatever may have been the objects
and disposition of the creator of the
Universe, they were certainly not those of
a gentleman.</p>

<p>But is the fact really unalterable? May
it not be the outcome of centuries of
servitude and seclusion, made absolute
by the knowledge that fidelity meant
bread and butter and a home, infidelity
starvation or the streets? Since the
beginnings of recorded history the great
bulk of women have, it is true, remained
monogamous, but they may have done
so from fear of losing their jobs as wives
if they did not. Those who have been rich
enough to stand upon their own financial
feet, or powerful enough to snap their
fingers at public opinion, have not been
remarkable for strict observance of the
marriage tie. The cases of Messalina,
Catherine the Great and the modern film
star, not to mention a score of less notorious
instances, are instructive. Significant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
too is the frequency of divorce among those
who are sufficiently well to do to afford
the enormous fees exacted by the legal
profession from those who wish to change
their partners. It is difficult, in the face
of evidence of this kind, to avoid the
conclusion that the monogamous tendencies
of women are the product of
training, circumstance, and environment,
and will not outlast the economic
disabilities which produced them.</p>

<p>In any event the present existence of
these tendencies, if tendencies they be,
affords no indication of what they may
become in the future. The fact that the
primitive savage could only count on
the fingers of one hand does not invalidate
the existence of the multiplication table,
any more than the fact that most women
want only one man each now proves that
they will not want more in a hundred
years. The use of the word ‘natural’
begs the question. We acquire those
characteristics which our circumstances
and environment demand, and then
transmit them to our children in whom,
being inherited, they are termed natural.
But this does not mean that our children
will not in due course develop new characteristics
of their own, if a change of
circumstances renders the old ones undesirable.
There are signs indeed that
the new characteristics are already beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
to appear. The attitude of representative
up-to-date women on this
subject is curious. They tend to deny the
difference between males and females
which my imaginary biologist alleged, and
to declare that their inclinations are
naturally as promiscuous as those of their
husbands. The circumstance that they
control them better argues, they assert,
more sense; it does not imply a difference
in nature.</p>

<p>Remarks of this kind are often made by
women who, nevertheless, live exemplary
lives and would scorn to revenge themselves
upon an unfaithful husband by
imitating his conduct. Nevertheless there
is no reason to suppose that they deliberately
misrepresent their feelings, and
we can only conclude that, as usually
happens, a new tendency is manifesting
itself in feeling some time before it is
translated into action.</p>

<p>For these reasons I do not think that
any convincing arguments as to the future
can be based on the alleged monogamousness
of women in the present. Nor, so
soon as the force of the monogamous
habit wanes, do I think that women will
consent to put up with the manifest
disadvantages of a system which is based
upon the assumption that it is as strong
as it ever was. It is certain that they will
not be deterred by the protests of outraged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
males. Conventional morality, as I have
already pointed out, like many of our
other institutions such as matinées, concerts
and God, is kept going by women,
and directly women withdraw their support,
not all the opposition of men will
avail to save it.</p>

<p>What then is likely to happen?</p>

<p>Certainly not a relapse into complete
promiscuity. The belief that people are
fundamentally licentious, and that a
partial removal of the barriers with which
society has hedged about the business of
reproduction will precipitate the population
into a welter of unbridled license,
pleasantly shocking though it is to the
minds of respectable people, has absolutely
no foundation in fact.</p>

<p>This belief springs from the doctrine of
original sin, which has always been
popular among quiet and well-behaved
persons. If man is by nature wicked and
sinful, and woman is very little better,
then, indeed, contraception and the
economic independence of women will lead
to an orgy of sex indulgence in which the
population will shuffle itself like a pack
of cards.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind is likely to happen.</p>

<p>The purely sexual elements in love
have come to occupy an entirely disproportionate
amount of attention owing
to the taboos with which they have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
invested. Once these taboos are removed,
they will revert to their natural position
of comparative unimportance. If it were
permissible to reproduce the sexual act
upon the stage we should all lose our
interest in chorus girls’ legs. Moreover,
playwrights would not trouble to avail
themselves of the permission.</p>

<p>Within reason, continence and constancy
are natural to human beings. It is
only the intolerable strain to which our
absurd social arrangements have subjected
them that has caused us to regard
ourselves as being by nature unfaithful
and incontinent. There is no ground for
the belief that the average man or woman
who allow themselves to be guided by
their own impulses must needs be
scoundrels. For among their impulses
must be numbered self-respect, moderation,
and a sense of what is right and
fitting. Because this sense may be, and
often is, at variance with the herd
morality which is crystallized in the
law, it does not mean that it does
not exist. On the contrary, it may be in
advance of the morality it disowns, so
that people thrown helpless on their
passions may find that honesty, that
self-respect, that hatred of cowardice and
deceit, and the desire for cleanliness,
health, and efficiency were master passions
disciplining them far more effectively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
than the artificial inhibitions of a
mediaeval morality based on an obsolete
religion and deriving its power from
lethargy and fear.</p>

<p>Some changes in social arrangements
there will no doubt be. In Russia, for
example, where the knowledge of birth-control
is accessible to all classes, where
any two parties by agreement, or either
of the two parties by request, may obtain
a divorce, and where no stigma is placed
upon illegitimacy, there has been a considerable
relaxation of the family system.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
If this means, as it probably does, that
unhappy families have broken up and
that husbands and wives who disliked
each other have availed themselves of
the opportunity to make a fresh start,
we need not regret the change. Nobody
would contend that society is the gainer
by condemning the unhappily married
to a lifetime of domestic misery, and it is
difficult to see why the common sense of
the community which considers the wishes
of the parties concerned a sufficient ground
for consummating their marriage does
not regard the wishes of the same parties
as a sufficient reason for terminating it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> <cite>Report of Labour Delegation</cite>, 1925. It is
interesting to note that this relaxation has taken
place concurrently with a marked decrease in
prostitution.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand it is unlikely that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
those who are happily married will rush
to the Registrar with the object of making
themselves miserable by separating, simply
because reasonable divorce laws give them
the opportunity to do so. It would be an
interesting experiment, and one which
would enable us to estimate the extent
of marital unhappiness, to proclaim a
day of conjugal amnesty at recurring
intervals. We might, for example, celebrate
the coronation of every new king
by giving to all married couples the right
to dissolve their marriages, and seek other
mates. If advantage were not taken of
the facilities offered within twenty-four
hours, there would be a compulsory
reversion to the <i lang="la">status quo ante</i>. Or
it might be better to fix definite periods
between the days of amnesty, so that
they would recur at regular intervals.
Each general election might serve as a
signal for a conjugal General Post, so that
couples would have the chance of gaining
their freedom every five years. I myself
would advocate the institution of such
amnesties, although I believe that the
amount of conjugal dislocation they would
cause would be surprisingly small. It
is difficult to avoid feeling sentimental
at the prospect of parting even from
those whom we dislike, and the fact
that couples were no longer bound in
law would only tighten the bonds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
sentiment. A would feel that, unpleasant
as B had been, he could not very well
let her down, and B would shrink from
leaving A with no one to look after him,
even when she had herself looked after
him very badly. You cannot, in short,
live with any one for a number of years
without dreading the prospect of their
loss. The knowledge, moreover, that
quinquennial escape was possible might
lead to married people treating their
partners with at least the degree of
civility they at present reserve for their
acquaintances. I do not think, therefore,
that the changes caused by a conjugal
amnesty would be very extensive.</p>

<p>For the above reasons I conclude that
the social results of the changes I have
been describing will amount to little
more than a diminution in the number
of unhappy marriages, and an increase in
the number of experimental unions.</p>

<p>But it is not to be supposed that the
herd will see the matter in this light.
Nothing exceeds the license taken by the
imaginations of very rigid people, and
there is little doubt that the vast mass
of respectable citizens, appalled and
horrified by what they will insist on regarding
as the prospect of growing and
unlimited license, will rise to meet the
situation with panic and persecution.
And since, for the reasons already given,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
morality in a modern community is that
kind of conduct which suits the stronger,
we may expect a revival of Puritanism
expressing itself in a new robustness
and acerbity in the moral sense of the
herd.</p>

<p>Symptoms of this revival are not wanting
in this country. If, however, we wish to
see the clearest portents of what is coming
we must, as I have hinted above, look
to America. America, as I have already
pointed out, leads the world in morals
as in everything else. That American
citizens set great store by morality is
notorious. With their constant Purity
Crusades, Puritan pogroms, Vigilance
Committees, and popular juries of selected
citizens, who visit surreptitiously and
report upon the moral tone of New York
plays, they put our more decadent civilization
to shame. On what sort of lines do
these engines of American morality take
action? One instance must suffice. In
April of this year, one Miss Jewell
Barker went bicycling in white knickers.
Her outraged neighbours showed their
sense of this vicious act by proceeding
to seize and flog Miss Barker’s father.
This is at once to usurp and to invert
the divine privilege of visiting the sins of
the fathers upon the children.</p>

<p>America is, of course, pre-eminently the
Land of Liberty, and we cannot hope to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
emulate her highest feats. Efforts are,
however, not wanting of our endeavours
to live up to the standard our cousins set.</p>

<p>I will quote at random one or two
American examples with their British
parallels.</p>

<p><i>America.</i> There is sumptuary legislation
designed to check the license of the
stage. “There is”, we are told, “a rule
in some American towns that the chorus
girls must wear stockings, although the
principals are allowed to appear with
bare legs”.</p>

<p><i>England.</i> In recent months there has
been a strong provincial movement against
the indecency and unpleasantness of the
plays produced in London. Respectable
citizens complain that they never can tell
what salacious beastliness may not be
sprung upon their protesting eyes and ears,
what searchlight cast upon the Augæan
stables of high society. Actors and
actresses have expressed their views,
pointing out that a pure stage is as good
a paying proposition as a nasty one, and
invoking the case of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas to bear witness to the truth of
their contention. These operas, a
notorious commercial success, have never
been known to bring a blush to the most
bourgeois cheek. A number of London
women have accordingly banded themselves
together vowing to purify the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
stage. Protests are to be made nightly
in theatres at which plays to which objection
is taken are performed. “We shall
stick at nothing,” said the leader of the
campaign, “to make our protest effective”.</p>

<p>Concurrently with this development
there has arisen a demand for a stricter
censorship. I think it probable that
we are on the threshold of a period
resembling the early seventeenth or
middle nineteenth centuries, when life
as it is will be driven off the stage by the
Puritans’ demand for life as it ought to
be, love will give place to sentiment,
and reality to romance.</p>

<p><i>America.</i> A new teetotal version of the
Bible is promised from America. The festive
passages are all dry, the words ‘raisin
cake’ taking the place of the word ‘wine’
wherever the latter occurs in the
Authorized Version. Thus we have “And
he dealt to everyone of Israel, both men
and women, to everyone a roll of bread,
a portion of meat and a cake of raisin”.</p>

<p><i>Scotland.</i> Steps were taken in the spring
of this year to transfer to Scotland a film
depicting the explorations of Livingstone.
An extract from the daily paper tells us
that “Prohibitionists there are already
strenuously objecting to the incident
which shows Livingstone, after he has
been found by Stanley, drinking champagne
with his rescuer! The difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
is that the incident is historically correct
... and the problem is whether truth
should be suppressed in the interests of
morality. ‘At any rate’ said the
Secretary of the London Missionary
Society ‘the raising of the question <em>is
evidence of the progress made since his
time</em>.’” It can scarcely be doubted that
if the meeting had taken place to-day,
Livingstone would have acknowledged
the march of progress by drinking water.</p>

<p>A straw shows the direction of the wind,
and I should not be at all surprised to see
Scotland go dry in the next fifty years,
especially if she is successful in obtaining
Home Rule. If Scotland goes dry, it
is not to be expected that England will
fail ultimately to follow suit. The increase
in efficiency among dry workmen is very
great, and if the business men remain
“the stronger” in the community, they
cannot continue indefinitely to be blind
to its advantages, especially as they
themselves would be immune from the
hardships it entails. If we ask whether
an officially dry but unofficially wet
business class, and a working class which
is dry both officially and unofficially,
does not mean one law for the rich and
another for the poor, our answer is that conventional
morals always does mean this.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Cp. the case of the legs of the chorus and the
principals, <a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>The practice of virtue, we are often
told, is dependent upon the possession
of a sufficient income. It is only the well
to do who can afford to be generous,
honest, and unselfish, because they have
no temptation to be otherwise. But what
is true of virtue is equally true of vice,
and the experience of the working of
prohibition in America shows how easy
it is for the rich to procure illicit indulgences
which are out of the reach of the
poor.</p>

<p>There is likely to be legislation against
wantonness in dress. By wantonness
is meant the practice among females of
unnecessarily exposing parts of their
body. The curious belief that the body
is in some way disgraceful, and that the
exhibition of it is, therefore, wicked is
very prevalent among Western peoples.
It arises partly from natural prudery,
partly from the property view of marriage,
and partly from the inclemency of the
climate which makes bathing a comparative
rarity. The Japanese who have
a bath twice a day, observe no discrimination
between the sexes in their bathing.
“One day”, said the Marquis of X who
had just returned from Japan, “my wife
went to have a bath, and she got as far
as the rinsing stage when two young
Japanese came in. She had to take
refuge in the tank, screaming at the top<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of her voice until the two young men
were taken away. They no doubt thought
her a very fastidious young woman”.</p>

<p>The conviction that the body is wicked
and ought to be concealed is important,
because it leads women to expose portions
of it which they would otherwise protect,
and rightly protect, from the rigours of
the atmosphere, in the belief that they
are making themselves attractive. Thus
women swathed in layers of furs in respect
of the rest of their persons, will venture
forth on the coldest day with bare bosoms
and open-work stockings. It is with the
same object that, though their religion
bids them mortify the flesh and refrain
from making of themselves a stumbling
block to others, they will appear at
dinner with necks, bosoms, backs, and
arms completely naked, a proceeding
not only acquiesced in but encouraged
by their males. This sort of thing is
anathema to the herd, who cannot afford
the evening dress and the furs, and to
the old, the condition of whose bodies does
not, except in the case of the incurably
optimistic, permit them to take the same
liberties as their daughters. Hence we
may expect a considerable stiffening of
public opinion in the matter of decorum
in dress and a return to the days in which
everything except the hands and the
face was carefully covered up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>In the sphere of what is called sexual
morality we may expect a growing tendency
to make wickedness (that is to
say conduct which is not in the interests
of the stronger) punishable by law.
Attempts will be made, and successfully
made, to multiply crimes by Act of
Parliament.</p>

<p>A good example of this tendency will be
found in the Bill entitled <cite>The Children,
Young Persons, etc., Bill</cite>, introduced by
a Labour Member during the tenure of
office by the Labour Government in
1924. It represents bourgeois or herd
morality “in excelsis.” It is known as
the <cite>Offences against the Person Bill</cite>, and
its object is to codify and extend the
existing enactments against abortion,
cruelty to children, offences against children,
and neglect of children. Many
of its provisions are admirable and
afford what is no doubt a necessary
protection to children against suffering
and neglect. Nevertheless it menaces
individual liberty in two ways. In the
first place it increases the number of
offences punishable by law, often in an
arbitrary manner. For example, it is made
a crime punishable by two years hard
labour for a girl of sixteen to have intercourse
with a young man of eighteen,
the criminal being not, as one might have
expected, the elder of the two parties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
concerned, but the girl. She alone is
liable to imprisonment; the young man
is allowed to go free. It is also a criminal
offence to conceal the birth of a dead
child, to cause or encourage a child to beg,
or to celebrate the marriage of a boy and a
girl under sixteen, such marriages being
declared invalid.</p>

<p>In the second place the Bill authorizes
grave interference with personal privacy.
The officers and inspectors charged with
executing its multifarious provisions are
given unlimited powers of search, and
authorized in certain cases to arrest
without warrant. Even if a bill of this
kind were to be administered by angels or
sages, the opportunities for espionage and
surveillance which it bestows would be
sufficiently offensive. Since, however, its
provisions will in fact be enforced by
inspectors and constables drawn from the
lower middle classes, who will be only too
willing to denounce as flagrant immorality
whatever transcends the experience of
Clapham, the measure stands revealed
as an attempt to endow the herd with
increased powers of interference and
control over the private lives of those
who venture to stand outside it.</p>

<p>Encouragement would also be given to
malevolent and offensive persons who
wished to do harm to their neighbours
by laying information against them. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
general, liberty would be diminished,
offences multiplied, and the individual
rendered more subservient to public
opinion than is the case to-day.</p>

<p>Another expression of herd feeling will
be a growing tendency to enquire into the
private lives of those who hold public
appointments. The herd, that is to say,
will increasingly demand of those who fill
positions of eminence and authority in the
land that they shall conform in practice,
and profess to conform in belief, to
the code of prejudices and preferences
which it pretentiously calls its morals.
Even to-day, at the end of half a century
of individualist thinking, fitness to perform
a particular job is one of the least
important qualifications in a candidate.
What is important is that he shall be a
member of a recognized religious sect,
such as the Church of England or one
of the sub-sects of Nonconformity, that
he shall live with one wife, avoid divorcing
and being divorced, and display
studiously temperate habits. He must
also exercise discretion in his public
utterances, be judiciously but not violently
patriotic in his sentiments, eschew extreme
views in politics, refrain from supporting
unpopular causes, and on all occasions
give the herd the answers it expects.
Thus in Wales it is difficult if not impossible
for a man to hold any public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
appointment unless he is a member of
a particular chapel, and at English
Universities many teaching posts are
reserved for those in Holy Orders. Given
the capacity for reflecting the opinions and
flattering the prejudices of the many,
men of acknowledged incompetence may
successfully aspire to the most responsible
posts. There is indeed no post in the
country a man cannot hold with credit,
if he can only succeed in holding his
tongue.</p>

<p>Conformity rather than intelligence is
more particularly required of those who
seek to instruct the young. A man’s
ability to demonstrate the differential
calculus or impart the facts of history
would not, it is true, appear to be lessened
by his having passed through the divorce
court. Yet there is no doubt that such
an event will cast a blight upon his
career as a teacher. People are too
satisfied with their own ways of thought
and habits of conduct to wish for their
children anything better than that they
should think and act as they do themselves.
What is demanded of the teacher,
therefore, is that he should transmit to
the children the same beliefs as those
which are held by their parents. He
must hold up to their admiration those
things which their parents consider to
be admirable, such as God, vaccination,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
monogamy, the Treaty of Versailles and
the capitalist system, and speak with
scorn and contempt of Bolshevism,
atheism, Germany, free love and agitators,
whom parents consider to be evil. When
the teacher does this he is what is called
a safe man. He inspires confidence and
obtains preferment. Provided, in short,
that he guarantees not to teach anything
new, his capacity to teach anything at all
is not seriously questioned. And, since
the best minds of every generation, being
in advance of their time, would prefer not
to teach at all rather than to perpetuate
the dogmas in which they have ceased to
believe, the successful teacher is not always
remarkable for intelligence.</p>

<p>In any event, whether intelligent or
not, he must conform, and will have to do
so increasingly. The herd morality which
drove a statesman of the calibre of Dilke
out of public life because it disapproved of
his private life, is, after a temporary
relapse, increasing in strength, and in the
immediate future nobody who does not
profess the morality to which the middle
classes adhere will stand any chance of
public office. If a man’s actions belie
his professions he must be careful to
conceal them.</p>

<p>One of the results of this development
will be an increase in hypocrisy.
To-day the agnostic don at Oxford
worships regularly in the College Chapel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and men will be driven increasingly to
give lip-service to ideals and shibboleths
which in their hearts they despise. In
general, the gulf which separates public
profession and private practice, a gulf
which has made England a byword for
hypocrisy, will grow wider. Driven to
profess the beliefs of shopkeepers, men
will rely increasingly upon their private
judgment as a sanction for their conduct.
Hence the attempt to impose a uniform
standard based upon an obsolete morality
upon our public men may lead to a revival
of that unfashionable organ the private
conscience, and those from whom an unwilling
conformity is exacted in public, will
insist that they and they alone are the judges
of what is right and wrong in private.</p>

<p>I have taken the <cite>Offences against the
Person Bill</cite> as a typical instance of the
kind of legislation in which the new
Puritanism may express itself. It indicates
a return to the Greek conception that
men can be made good by Act of Parliament.
In the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries this conception was
regarded with disfavour. As the result of
the individualist thinking of the preceding
fifty years, the idea that there was one
good life which all men ought to lead had
been abandoned. The individualist view
was that there were different kinds of
good lives for different men, as many in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
fact as there were men to live them, and
that it was, therefore, impracticable to
establish by law a positive standard of
ethical conduct to which all must conform.
In so far as law had any function
in the matter, it was, by prohibiting
violence and the cruder forms of robbery,
to guarantee to the community a certain
background of order without which no
good life was possible. Since the mere
process of obeying the law did not make
a man a good man but only restrained
him from certain unappetizing kinds of
vice by which no decent upper or middle
class citizen was attracted, it followed that
the function of the law was negative
merely; its object was to prevent citizens
from so conducting themselves that
nobody could be virtuous, not to define
virtue or to tell men how to attain it.
The definition of virtue was a matter for
the individual’s insight, and the attainment
of virtue a matter for the individual’s
conscience; provided, therefore, that a
man abstained from the grosser forms of
anti-social conduct which were prohibited
by law, the question of what he ought
to do, and what refrain from doing, was
one which he alone could decide.</p>

<p>I believe that this nineteenth and
early-twentieth century libertarianism in
matters of thought and conduct is decreasing
and will continue to decrease. The cult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of uniformity is hostile to the liberty of the
individual, and in order to secure the
performance of conduct of which the herd
approves, the legislature is likely to
assume a more positive control over men’s
lives than has been customary in the
past. We shall, in other words, revert
to the conception of one good life for all
men, or rather for all poor men, a good life
which it is conceived to be the business of
the State and of public opinion to promote.</p>

<p>Summing up, therefore, we may predict
the immediate future somewhat as follows:
Coming into contact with the increased
facilities for freedom of action to which
reference has been made, the new itch
to regulate men’s lives will lead to persecution
and heresy-hunting. Men will
be hounded out of public life because of
their private morals, and acceptance
of certain habits of belief and codes of
conduct will be made indispensable to the
holding of public appointments. Instead
of choosing for a post the man who is best
qualified to do the job, we shall choose the
man who most nearly reflects the habits
of thought and conduct of the selection
board, that is to say, of the herd who
elected the selection board to represent
them. The growth of Puritanism will
bring a growth in hypocrisy, a fruitful
and invaluable offshoot of Puritanism.
There will be an even greater disparity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
between men’s practices and their professions
than there is at present, and their
professions will tend increasingly to condemn
their practices. The world, in short
will become a paradise for the average man
and a hell for the exceptional one.</p>

<p>So much we may expect during the
next fifty years. If, however, I am asked
which of the two opposing tendencies I
have attempted to describe in this book
will ultimately prevail, my answer is that
it will not be the bourgeois Puritanism
whose apparent victory I foresee in the
immediate future. Nor, indeed, do I
think that that victory will be more than
apparent.</p>

<p>The history of morals, like that of
politics, follows the swing of the pendulum,
and some reaction on the part of each
generation from the habits of its fathers
seems to be inevitable. In so reacting it
reverts to those of its fathers’ fathers.
Thus each generation tends to take the
gods of its grandfathers from the shelf
upon which its fathers have placed them.</p>

<p>To-day we are at the beginning of a
period of reaction from the license of
the War. The difference between young
people of between the ages of eighteen
and twenty-four and their predecessors
of seven years ago is very marked. The
latter were casual, offhand, and easy-going.
They observed little ceremonial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
in their relationships with each other,
smoked, flirted and made love when and
where they pleased, married in haste and
repented at leisure or dispensed with
marriage altogether, and despised rather
than revered the aged to whom they were a
constant source of horror and amazement.
What is perhaps most noticeable about
their successors to-day is their improvement
in manners. They are chivalrous
to women, considerate to the old, maintain
a decorum at dances which is
positively Victorian, and instead of hastening
to establish sexual relations with
whomsoever attracts them, have actually
gone out of their way to postpone the
fruition of their desires by a reintroduction
of the rite known as “engagement”.</p>

<p>In particular, women, no longer treated
as the equals of men, are alternatively
worshipped and disregarded, blown aloft
like soap bubbles or jettisoned as lumber.
The reaction, in short, is already well under
weigh, and its influence for many years to
come will be great.</p>

<p>But the normal cycle of action and
reaction, of licentious eighteenth and
Puritanical nineteenth centuries, depends
for its recurrence on the entrance of no
new factors; it is bound up that is to say
with the property status of women and the
production of children as the fruit of
sexual intercourse. Once new factors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
are introduced, it may well be thrown
permanently out of gear. Birth control
and the economic independence of women
are to my mind factors of this kind. The
changes they portend are incalculable, and,
though their full effects may be delayed
for two or three decades, no Puritan
revival nor any number of such revivals,
whether backed by the law or finding
expression in public opinion merely, will
in the long run be able to stand against
them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I am conscious that what I have written
in this book will seem to many to be
cynical and disruptive. I shall be charged
with taking a low view of human nature,
and speaking slightingly of morality. My
answer is, first, that what I have written
of in these pages is not human nature as
a whole, but that part of human nature
only which expresses itself in what is
called morality; and secondly, that what
is called morality is not in any true sense
of the word morality at all. Morality, as
I understand it, is positive: it insists that
certain things are good and ought to be
pursued even if the heavens fall. But
the habits of thought and standards of
conduct I have analyzed in this book,
although they are called morality, are not
positive but negative. Their appeal is
to men’s fears rather than to their hopes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
they tell them not what they must do to
be saved, but what they must not do if
they are to avoid the censure of society.
Their basis is the instinct to possess,
and their weapon the power to blame. Men
blame those who claim a liberty they dare
not assert for themselves, and dignify with
the name of morality the indulgence of
possessive instincts in which savages
glory without hypocrisy. “What could
I have done in the circumstances?”
asked the husband of an erring wife in
a recent society scandal case. “If you
ask me to tell you I will. You could
have told your wife that if she went
with the man again, you would get her
divorced. You could then have gone up
to London and assaulted Sir X Y, and to
hell with your career”, replied the eminent
counsel on the other side.</p>

<p>This is the law of the jungle; it is the
expression of most of what passes for
morality to-day, and, while it prevails,
there is little hope for the world. Of
positive morality which brings the conviction
that some things are good and
ought to be pursued for their own sake,
there has never been less. It is doubtful
indeed whether a positive morality can
exist without a strong and lively religious
feeling, and religion was never at so low
an ebb.</p>

<p>The emotional enthusiasm which religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
generates is indispensable to a true
morality. For good or for evil religion
is the looser of great forces. It may be
captured and made to serve base ends,
but under the influence of the emotion
which it creates men can be brought
to believe that some things <em>are</em> better
than others, and to overcome any obstacle
in order that the good things may prevail.
It is this belief which is lacking in the
world to-day.</p>

<p>Until, then, the life-force can contrive
again to send a great religious teacher into
the world, a true, positive morality will be
lacking. The man who is born in England
will continue to believe that it is right to
marry one wife, and the man who is born
in Persia will continue to believe that it
is right to marry four, and each will
invoke morality to justify his belief. Such
morality is merely topographical; it
reflects no conception of what is good,
and it gives us no hope that the world
can be made better because it does not
believe that its own world is bad.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the less we write and think
about morality the better. A world
without religion is a sad and a tiring world
because it lacks an object, and for this
reason there have been few generations
which have known less happiness than our
own. In such a world those who think
the least have the best of it. In such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
world reflection can only produce despondency,
and it is better to take our
professions and prejudices ready made
from the social shop, than to embark
on a sea of troubles by thinking out a
morality for ourselves, to act with the
business man rather than to brood with
the philosophers.</p>

<p>In a new and positive morality in which
men can believe lies the hope for the world;
yet such a morality cannot come without
a revival of religion. Religion and
religion alone gives the driving force which
impels men to change things, and until
a religious attitude to the world again
becomes part of man’s common heritage,
all the apparent changes in morality,
of which different ages and countries
are the witnesses, will fail to disguise
the fundamental fact that there is no
morality to change.</p>
